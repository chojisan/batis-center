          <p>The realization of Batis Center for Women’s vision of empowered women returnees and their families is the formation of Batis AWARE (Association of Women in Action for Rights and Empowerment), the self-help organization of Filipino women returnees from Japan in 1996 and Batis-YOGHI (Youh Organization that Gives Hope and Inspiration) composed of children of the women returnees in 2000.</p>

          <h2>Company Overview</h2>
          <p>Batis Center for Women was founded in 1988 as a joint initiative between the Division of Family Ministries of the National Council of Churches in the Philippines (NCCP) and the National Council of Churches in Japan (NCCJ) with the House in the Emergency of Love and Peace (HELP), the Asian Women’s Shelter of the Japan Women’s Christian Temperance Union. It was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 23, 1989. Batis Center for Women responded the growing incidence of abuse among Filipino women migrants and the systematic trafficking of Filipino women in the sex and entertainment industry of Japan. As the migration landscape in Japan changes, Batis Center for Women has also opened its doors to address the needs and concerns of returned Filipino women migrants in distress from Southeast Asia and Middle East since 2007. Cases being handled involved women migrants in highly feminized jobs particularly entertainment and domestic work.</p>
          <p>The realization of Batis Center for Women's vision of empowered women returnees and their families is the formation of Batis AWARE, the self-help organization of Filipino women returnees in 1996 and Batis-YOGHI (Youth Organization that Gives Hope and Inspiration) composed of children of the women returnees in 2000. Batis Center for Women organized the women and children to provide them with a means to provide support to one another as well as to address the issues confronting them as migrant workers and children of migrant workers, particularly Japanese-Filipino Children (JFC).</p>
          <p>At present, Batis Center for Women works with Batis AWARE and Batis-YOGHI as partners in addressing the issues of migration in general, and women migrant workers and their families in particular.</p>
